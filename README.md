# QuizMaster

## Project Scope

Develop an interactive text-based learning platform that transforms the courseâ€™s study material into engaging quizzes using LLM technology, allowing students to input their queries - and receive instantly generated multiple choice questions. With immediate feedback on answers and topic validation ensuring relevance to the course content, students can effectively test their knowledge and identify areas for review, making the studying process both more engaging and efficient.

## Project Positioning

Our platform serves a focused purpose - delivering multiple-choice questions tailored to course content. Unlike Blackboard's comprehensive learning management features or ChatGPT's broad AI capabilities, we offer a streamlined quiz experience with curated questions that are categorized and saved for repeated practice. This specialized approach creates a personal repository of course-specific practice material.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo.
2. Copy .env file from Discord channel to repo folder.
3. Run `npm i`
4. Run `npm run dev`
